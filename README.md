Welcome to my collection of Core Java Dsa Practice! This repository is a place for my dsa learning journey and for small, simple console-based applications built using only basic Java fundamentals 

About The Repo

The purpose of these repo is to provide hands-on practice with java coding. 

This repository contains my daily practice and mini projects as part of my Full Stack Developer learning journey.

Here I upload:
- Class assignments  
- Practice programs  
- Mini projects  
- Layout designs  

### 🎯 Goal
To build strong fundamentals

I will keep updating this repository regularly with new frontend projects and practice work.
