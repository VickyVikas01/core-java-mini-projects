Welcome to my collection of Core Java mini-projects! This repository is a place for small, simple console-based applications built using only basic Java fundamentals.

About The Projects

The purpose of these projects is to provide hands-on practice with foundational concepts without relying on complex frameworks or libraries. They are designed to be easily understandable for beginners and showcase simple, practical use cases for Core Java syntax.
Each project is contained within its own dedicated folder for better organization.
